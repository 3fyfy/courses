# Enterprise Architecture

- The architectural view of systems (both business and IT systems) is defined in ANSI/IEEE standard 1471-2000 as “the fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution”. Enterprises can be thought of as the combination of business needs, and IT capabilities. 
- Agile organizations are those where IT serves business needs, not limiting it.

## Enterprise Architecture Dimensions
- From enterprise point of view, architectures are classified into four categories: 
  - Business Architecture
  - Information Technology (IT) Architecture
  - Information Architecture
  - Application (software) Architecture
- EA tends to define the enterprise from the four dimensions in order to connect between them and present a complete view for the enterprise.
- EA classes utilize each other, and build over each other. 
- Distinctions between classes are blurred because they all serve each other, and serve the enterprise. 

### Business Architecture
- A business or business process architecture defines the 
  - business strategy
  - governance
  - organization
  - and key business processes within an enterprise. 
- The fields of Business Process Reengineering (BPR) and BPM focus on the analysis and design of business processes, not necessarily represented in an IT system. 
- Business Architecture defines the business roadmap usually via defining the business processes.

### IT Architecture
- The IT architecture defines the hardware and software building blocks that make up the overall IS of the organization. 
- IT architecture includes hardware and software infrastructure including DB and middleware technologies. 
- The IT architecture should enable achievement of the business goals using a software infrastructure that supports the procurement, development, and deployment of core mission-critical business applications. 
- The purpose of the IT architecture is to enable a company to manage its IT investment in a way that meets its business needs by providing a foundation upon which data and application architectures can be built.

### Information Architecture
- The data architecture of an organization includes logical and physical data assets and data management resources. 
- Information is becoming one of the most important assets a company has in achieving its objectives, and the IT architecture must support it. 
- Information Architecture spans Business and IT Architectures, brings them together, keeps them together, and provides the necessary rich contextual environment to solve the ubiquitous data-quality problem.

### Software Architecture
- **Software architecture** can be defined as “the sum of the nontrivial modules, processes, and data of the system, their structure and exact relationships to each other, how they can be and are expected to be extended and modified, and on which technologies they depend, from which one can deduce the exact capabilities and flexibility of the system, and from which one can form a plan for the implementation or modification of the system”. 
- **Application Architecture** defines the form and function of the applications that will be developed to deliver the required functionality of the system.
