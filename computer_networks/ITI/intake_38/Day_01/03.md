### Benefits of Computer Networks
Resources Sharing
- File Sharing 
- Peripheral Sharing 
- Software Sharing with multi-user licenses

### Basic Network Elements
Hardware
- Computers / Peripherals
- NICs
- Connecting Media
- Networking Device(s)
  - Routers
  - Switches
  - Bridges 
  - Hubs 
- Software
- Protocols
  - Communication rules that all entity must agree on

### Network Devices
- NIC (Network Interface Card)
  - The hardware that plugs into the motherboard and directly access the network
- Hub
  - Allow different nodes to communicate with each other
- Switch
  - Allow different nodes to communicate with each other
at the same time without slowing each other down. 	
- Router
  - Allow different networks to communicate with each other
